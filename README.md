# Real_Time_Eye_Detection
Using computer vision techniques, real-time eye detection with OpenCV identifies and tracks the eyeballs in a live video stream, usually recorded from a camera. First, OpenCV is used to capture the video frames in real time. The system uses an OpenCV-based pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to identify faces before identifying eyes. The eyes are most usually positioned in a region of interest (ROI) that is designated once the face has been recognized. Then, within this ROI, the specially trained Haar Cascade classifier for eye recognition is utilized to reliably identify the eyes. Bounding boxes are drawn around the eyeballs in the video frames to visually show their positions once they are discovered.
